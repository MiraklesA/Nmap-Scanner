# Nmap-Scanner
Basic tool that runs multiple nmap scans on one device rather then needing to remember the syntaxes for the command. 



I do plan to modify this tool as it does have versatility, will create a seperate version of this that uses a little bit of heavier commands for more indepth scanning. 

To be used for defensive security.
